## Assem Chelli

A senior software engineer, mainly backend using Python and JS. I am more of a ship builder than a ship maintainer.

I've experience in those domains: 
- Ecommerce
- Delivery
- Ride hailing
- Search and Arabic NLP

The stack I prefer to work with: FastAPI, Django,  Node.js, React-native. You may check my starred lists [here](https://github.com/assem-ch?tab=stars).  

### Active projects that I maintain
- [django-jet-reboot](https://github.com/assem-ch/django-jet-reboot), a django admin based on django-jet that actually supports django 3.0 and django 4.0.
- [arabicstemmer](https://github.com/assem-ch/arabicstemmer), an Arabic Light Stemmer aimed mainly to improve search.

### For students and fresh graduates
If you have some knowledge in the stack:  python, react, react-native , and looking for an oppurtunity, you can contact me and I'll refer you to open positions in my network.
